## What

I'm not actually interested in building an MMORPG as a commercial project. As a long-time fan of the genre, I've always been curious how games like Ultima Online, World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy XIV (and XI!) work. So this is just a research project to see how far I can push online lobbies, how instancing works, authoritative server architectures and so on.
